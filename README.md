# Topic: *Bottleneck traveling salesman problem*
**Bottleneck traveling salesman problem** is an optimization problem that consists in determining, given a list of cities and the distances between all pairs of cities, the shortest circuit that passes through each city once and only once.
## Complexity
The problem is NP-complete.
It can be reduced to hamiltonian cycle.
## Example
### Consider cities A, B, C, D and distances between them.<br/>

### Here with have a path that goes through all cities exactly once.

## Applications
**Bottleneck traveling salesman problem** has a lot of applications, motivated by some concrete problems, like school bus route.<br/> 
A classic application is in logistics(deliveries, post office etc..).<br/> 
It's also used in biology(genome sequencing for example).<br/>
