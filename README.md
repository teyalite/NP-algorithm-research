# Topic: *Bottleneck traveling salesman problem*
**Bottleneck traveling salesman problem** is an optimization problem that consists in determining, given a list of cities and the distances between all pairs of cities, the shortest circuit that passes through each city once and only once.
## Complexity
The problem is NP-complete.
It can be reduced to hamiltonian cycle.
